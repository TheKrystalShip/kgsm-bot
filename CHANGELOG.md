## [Unreleased]

### Changed — the leaf config descriptor is generated, not written
- **`deploy/kgsm-bot.leaf.json` is now written by `TheKrystalShip.KGSM.LeafConfig` on every build**, from
  `[LeafField]` attributes and `<panel>` doc tags on `the bound options classes`. A knob lives in two places —
  the property and the settings-file key — instead of three, and the descriptor cannot describe a
  variable this leaf does not read: the `env` name is derived from the property's position under its
  bound section, and the default from the settings file itself. **Edit the settings class, not the
  JSON.**
- **A field's operator-facing prose comes from a `<panel>` tag**, falling back to `<summary>` with a
  build message naming the field. The two are separate because they answer different questions: the
  summary tells a developer what the value means to the code, the panel tells whoever runs the host
  what changing it does.
- **`LeafDescriptorTests` is gone.** Every check it made — settings coverage in both directions, the
  field vocabulary, group and `dependsOn` references, enum values and defaults, bounds, floor-source
  order — now runs in the generator, at the point the file is produced rather than after, and in one
  implementation shared by every leaf instead of a copy per repo.
- The package is **build-only** and declares no dependencies: the attributes arrive as source and the
  generator reads this assembly's metadata in its own process, so nothing reaches the published
  output and this leaf gains no reflection.

### Fixed — the bot could not resolve its own Discord server

- **`Discord__GuildId` binds.** The config file spelled the key `Discord:Guild`, which matches no
  property on `DiscordOptions`, so the guild id was **0** on every run — visible in the journal as
  *"Initializing server event coordinator for guild 0"*. With a guild of 0 the bot signs in and
  reports status normally, but it cannot resolve the server it belongs to: creating a channel for a
  newly installed game server fails with *"Could not find guild with ID 0"*, and removing one on
  uninstall fails the same way. Both work again.

### Changed — one settings file, and it declares the whole surface

- **`appsettings.json` is now `kgsm-bot.settings.json`**, matching the ecosystem's
  `kgsm-<leaf>.settings.json` naming — and it is **committed**, because it holds no secret. It
  declares the bot's whole configurable surface with its defaults, and `Program.cs` loads it by
  absolute path from the binary's own directory rather than the process working directory.
  `appsettings.example.json` is gone: with the real file committed, it was a second copy of the same
  declarations, and it had already drifted from both the code and the live file.
- **The token and this host's Discord identity moved to `/etc/kgsm-bot/kgsm-bot.env`** — the guild,
  the channel category and the action role, which are this host's and not the product's.
- **Nine settings the bot binds but the file never declared are now declared**, with the value the
  code already used: `KGSM__JournalDir`, `KGSM__WatchdogSocketPath`, `Ollama__Temperature`/`Seed`/
  `Think`, `Conversation__DatabasePath`, and the three `LlmAgent` knobs.
- **Four dead keys are gone**: `KGSM__SocketPath` (the engine moved to the event journal) and
  `Conversation__MaxMessages`/`IdleTimeoutMinutes` (the history is append-only canon, bounded by
  checkpoints rather than trimmed), plus the misspelled `Discord__Guild` above.
- **`floorSources` lists the settings file first.** The list is lowest-precedence-first, so with the
  file listed last the Control Panel resolved a knob to the file's value and reported it as the
  deployed one — showing a blank where the unit sets a real path.

### Added
- **Four tests hold the settings file, the bound options classes and the leaf descriptor together**:
  a key in the file that binds to nothing, a bound setting the file never declares, a descriptor
  default that disagrees with the file, and an env template naming a key the file does not declare
  each fail the build. The first two are what would have caught the guild id.

### Changed — kgsm-lib 2.0.0 (the socket event transport is gone)
- **Pinned to `TheKrystalShip.KGSM.Lib` 2.0.0**, which removes `UnixSocketClient`,
  `KgsmEventTransport` and `KgsmOptions.SocketPath`/`EventTransport`. This service already read the
  journal, so the only change here is dropping the now-nonexistent `EventTransport = Journal` line —
  there is no transport left to select. No behaviour change.

### Fixed — a lifecycle event announced once, not once per gateway reconnect

- **`Initialize` is now idempotent, and the event coordinator is a singleton.** Discord's gateway
  READY fires again on every reconnect, and the READY handler re-ran the coordinator's
  initialization — which *appends* callbacks to the event handler's lists. So after one reconnect
  every start/stop announced twice, after two reconnects three times, for the life of the process.
  Observed live at 2× on this host. Guarded in both `ServerEventCoordinatorService.Initialize` and
  `KgsmServerEventHandler.Initialize`, and the coordinator's transient registration — the reason a
  guard alone could not have been enough — is now a singleton, matching how it is actually held.

### Changed — engine events come from the journal, not a socket

- **`KGSM__JournalDir` replaces `KGSM__SocketPath`.** The bot tails the engine's append-only event
  journal instead of binding a socket for the engine to dial out to. It no longer owns a path that
  another consumer could collide with, and the engine no longer needs to be told this consumer
  exists — a journal is a file any number of readers share. The four announcement handlers are
  unchanged.

  **The bot reads from the tail and keeps no position between runs**, deliberately. It *announces*
  to Discord channels, and an announcement is only meaningful while it is current: replaying a
  backlog on restart would post "server started" for a server that started and stopped hours ago.
  Missing what happened during a restart is the right trade — the durable record is kgsm-monitor's,
  and this surface was never it.

### Added — the Control Panel can configure the bot
- **`deploy/kgsm-bot.leaf.json` declares every setting the bot binds** — all 27, across Discord
  identity and channel behaviour, the KGSM connection, the inventory cache, the model and the agent
  loop, each with its type, coded default, bounds, unit and risk. `deploy.sh` installs it into
  `/var/lib/kgsm/leaves/`, where kgsm-api scans for it and renders the bot's configuration page.
  This makes the bot configurable from the Control Panel for the first time; editing also needs
  kgsm-api's `deploy/setup-leaf-config.sh` re-run to wire the restart channel, and until then the
  panel shows the values read-only and says why.
- **A coverage test fails the build if the descriptor and the code disagree.** It walks the options
  types the bot actually binds, in both directions. It also caught that the two per-name maps
  (`KGSM:Blueprints`, `KGSM:Instances`) cannot be delivered as one environment variable, so they are
  named as a pinned exclusion rather than promised on the panel.
- The Discord token is write-only; the token, both ids and all three socket paths are marked
  `wiring`. Deleting a server's channel along with the server, and the conversation database path,
  are `destructive` — each loses history that is not recoverable from elsewhere.

### Changed — headless deploys (`setup.sh` once, `deploy.sh` forever after)
- **`deploy/setup.sh` provisions the host once** (asks for sudo; idempotent): chowns `/opt/kgsm-bot`
  to the deploying user, seeds `/etc/kgsm-bot/kgsm-bot.env`, puts the real unit in
  `/etc/kgsm-bot/systemd/` with `/etc/systemd/system/kgsm-bot.service` symlinked to it, installs a
  polkit grant scoped to this project's units, enables the unit, and verifies the grant with the same
  unprivileged `systemctl` calls `deploy.sh` makes.
- **`deploy/deploy.sh` runs with no `sudo` and no prompts**, and refuses up-front (before building)
  with "run `deploy/setup.sh`" when the host is not provisioned. It still never touches the live env
  file, so the Discord token survives a redeploy.
- `deploy/deploy-common.sh` carries the project block plus the shared helpers, sourced by both entry
  points so they cannot drift. Canonical template and contract:
  `tks/scripts/deploy-template/README.md`.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- **Regression test pinning the bot's unknown-event tolerance** (`KgsmServerEventHandlerUnknownEventTests`):
  asserts `KgsmServerEventHandler.Initialize` registers exactly the four instance lifecycle handlers
  (installed/started/stopped/uninstalled) and zero `RegisterRawHandler` calls. kgsm-lib's
  `EventService.OnEventReceivedAsync` already takes the safe path on an unrecognised or unhandled
  event type — `_eventTypeMapping` miss logs "Unknown event type" and returns; a hit whose data type
  has no registered handler logs "No handler registered" and returns — so the bot never sees envelope
  types it didn't subscribe to. Phase 2 of `blueprint-editor-plan.md` added three `blueprint_*` event
  types, which the bot deliberately ignores; this test locks that invariant so a future raw-handler
  refactor in the bot would force a re-evaluation of unknown-event tolerance rather than silently
  inheriting it from kgsm-lib.

### Fixed
- **`ServerOperations` (the bot's `IServerOperations` adapter) now implements `GetConfiguredPortsAsync`
  and `WriteInstanceFileAsync`** as honest-degrade stubs returning a "not available on the Discord
  surface" failure — the same pattern as the existing `ReadInstanceFileAsync`/`ListInstanceDirectoryAsync`
  stubs. The two methods were added to the assistant's `IServerOperations` port (`kgsm-llm`) and the
  bot's adapter had not been resynced, which broke the build of `KGSM.Bot.Discord` (and by transitive
  reference the test project). No behavior change on Discord: both tools fall back to the failure path
  the bot already reported for the other assistant-only capabilities.
